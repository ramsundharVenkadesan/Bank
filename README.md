# 🏦 Banking Backend System

A modular **banking backend system** implemented in **Python**, designed to handle **secure authentication, transaction processing, and database operations**. This project simulates the backend logic of a real-world banking application, emphasizing security, modularity, and scalability.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**
  - Handles user login, registration, and token validation.
  - Secure password handling and session management.

- **Account Management**
  - Create, retrieve, and manage user bank accounts.
  - Update balances and account details securely.

- **Transaction Processing**
  - Supports deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers.
  - Ensures atomic operations and data consistency.

- **Database Integration**
  - Modular database layer for persistent storage.
  - Clean abstraction between logic and data.

- **RESTful API Layer**
  - Organized endpoints for all core banking operations.
  - Follows REST conventions for easy integration with frontend or mobile clients.

## 🧩 Project Structure

```
├── API_Operations.py     # Defines all RESTful API endpoints
├── Application.py        # Entry point for running the backend app
├── Authentication.py     # Handles login, registration, and security logic
├── Database.py           # Manages DB connections and queries
└── requirements.txt      # Project dependencies (recommended)
```

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Framework:** FastAPI (for API and routing)
- **Database:** SQLite / PostgreSQL (configurable)
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Hashing:** bcrypt / hashlib

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

This project demonstrates:
- Clean **modular design** separating API, logic, and data layers.
- Secure **authentication mechanisms**.
- Robust **transaction integrity** using commit/rollback.
- **Error handling and input validation** using Pydantic models.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # on Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If `requirements.txt` isn’t present, you can manually install FastAPI and SQLAlchemy:)*  
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy bcrypt python-jose
```

### 4. Run the application
```bash
uvicorn Application:app --reload
```

The server will start at:  
👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 5. Test the API
Open the interactive Swagger UI:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

You can register a new user, log in, and perform account or transaction operations directly from the Swagger interface.

## 🔐 Security

- Passwords are never stored in plain text.
- JWT-based session management.
- Input validation for all endpoints to prevent injection attacks.

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add audit logging for all transactions.  
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Integrate with a real database cluster (e.g., PostgreSQL).  
- Add Docker and CI/CD pipeline support.
